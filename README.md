# Raid Shamer
Takes a screenshot of deaths during Theater of Blood. Also supports discord webhook integration.

Thanks to Zayre for the idea and socalova6 for bringing it to my attention.

This plugin by default just saves a photo of a TOB death to a folder called "Wall of Shame." I'm assuming if you're reading this, you are looking for discord webhook information.

## Example Discord Webhook message

## How to set up the webhook

First off you will need permissions in a Discord channel, or the ability to make your own. 

Click the settings gear beside a channel, then integrations, and then "View Webhooks." Click on "New Webhook."

Enter in a name, select the channel, then optionally upload a profile photo. Save your changes and click "Copy Webhook URL."

Open up Runelite and go to the settings for Raid Shamer. Click the box to turn on Discord Webhook support and then paste the URL into the text box.

This is not malicious and your webhook will never be sent to anyone else. That's all there is to it.
